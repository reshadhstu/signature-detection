# Signature Detection

This project fine-tunes a YOLO object detection model on the Ultralytics Signature Detection dataset to locate and classify handwritten signatures within diverse document images accurately. By training and evaluating on a variety of real‚Äêworld contexts, the model becomes a powerful tool for smart document analysis.

Key applications include:
- Document Verification: Automating signature checks in legal and financial paperwork
- Fraud Detection: Spotting forged or unauthorized signatures
- Digital Document Processing: Streamlining administrative and legal workflows
- Banking and Finance: Securing check processing and loan document validation
- Archival Research: Assisting historical document analysis and cataloging

Beyond practical deployments, this dataset and model serve educational and research purposes, enabling exploration of signature characteristics across multiple document types.
